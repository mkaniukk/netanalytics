  - Programming languages (PHP, Python, Ruby) with versions
  - Frameworks (Laravel, Django, Express, etc.)
  - JavaScript libraries (jQuery, React, Vue, Angular) with versions
  - Analytics platforms (Google Analytics, Tag Manager, Facebook Pixel)

### Infrastructure Detection
- **CDN Detection**: Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly, AWS CloudFront, and 10+ more
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, Oracle Cloud, Alibaba Cloud
- **Service Mesh**: Istio, Linkerd, Envoy, Consul Connect, Kuma, AWS App Mesh
- **Load Balancer**: NGINX, HAProxy, AWS ELB/ALB, GCP, Azure, Traefik
- **Container/Kubernetes**: Ingress controllers, container registries, orchestration platforms

### Network Analysis
- IP version (IPv4/IPv6)
- Reverse DNS lookup
- Port scanning (common ports: 21, 22, 23, 25, 80, 443, 3306, 5432, 8080)
- **Traceroute** - Full network path with hop-by-hop analysis (requires `--trace` flag)
- Network hop count and latency per hop

### Geolocation
- IP address location (country, city)
- ISP and organization information
- ASN (Autonomous System Number)
- Hosting provider detection
- Proxy and mobile detection

### Performance Metrics
- DNS lookup time
- TCP connection time

- Time to first byte (TTFB)
- Total request time
- Performance warnings for slow responses

### Content & Email Intelligence
- robots.txt, sitemap.xml, and security.txt discovery with byte sizes
- Highlights missing security.txt for quick hardening wins
- SPF and DMARC record inspection including enforced policy level

### Vulnerability Intelligence (Experimental)
- `--cve` flag performs opportunistic CVE lookups via the NVD API
- Automatically fingerprints web stack components (server, CMS, JS libraries, certificate metadata)
- Displays matching CVE IDs with severity, CVSS score, descriptions, and reference links
- Set `NVD_API_KEY` to raise rate limits; anonymous access still works for light usage

## Key Features Explained

### 🔍 Intelligent Findings Analysis
The tool automatically analyzes all collected data and highlights:
- **Critical Issues** (❌) - Expired certificates, severe security problems
- **Warnings** (⚠️) - Missing security headers, approaching certificate expiration, slow performance
- **Positive Findings** (✅) - Modern TLS, HTTP/3, strong encryption, CDN usage, proper DNS configuration
- **Informational** (ℹ️) - Detected technologies, configuration notes, infrastructure details

This makes it easy to quickly understand what matters most without reading through pages of detailed output.

### Version Detection
The tool intelligently extracts version numbers from:
- Server headers (e.g., `nginx/1.29.0`, `Apache/2.4.41`)
- X-Powered-By headers (e.g., `PHP/7.4.3`)
- Page content (JavaScript frameworks, CMS versions)
- Meta tags and embedded version strings

### Clean vs Verbose Mode
- **Default (Clean)**: Only shows detected items and important information
- **Verbose Mode** (`--verbose`): Shows all possible checks including "Not Set" items

This keeps the output focused and readable by default while still providing full details when needed.

## Dependencies

- `github.com/miekg/dns` - DNS query library

## API Usage

The tool uses the free ip-api.com service for geolocation data. No API key required for basic usage (limited to 45 requests per minute).

For CVE lookups it calls the public NVD 2.0 API. Supplying an `NVD_API_KEY` environment variable is optional but recommended to avoid throttling when scanning multiple hosts.
